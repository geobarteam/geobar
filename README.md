Simple framework, containing common building blocks.
It try to provide a thin wrapper around common libraries such as Log4Net.  It aims to minimize the friction of using these common libraries.  It diminish the number of choices you’ve to make by providing standard configurations and add-ins.  The goal is to start coding more quickly.   Also, because you work with common abstractions, you’re able to change your mind later on.
